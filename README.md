Resampling weather data to extract extremes

These separate notebooks perform block resampling on [EObs](https://www.ecad.eu/download/ensembles/download.php) temperature and precipitation data. 

The temperature data also has the option of including precipitation, in order to extract combinations of extremes (warm/wet) etc. on datafiles which have both temperature and precipitation variables. 

If you want to download this notebook you can use GitHub and [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)
