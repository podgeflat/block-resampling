# block-resampling
Resampling weather data to extract extremes

These separate notebooks perform block resampling on temperature and precipitation data. 

The temperature data also has the option of including precipitation, in order to extract combinations of extremes (warm/wet) etc. on datafiles which have both temperature and precipitation variables. 

If you want to download this notebook you can use GitHub and [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)
